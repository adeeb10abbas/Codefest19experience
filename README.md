When we first found out about the concept of a 24 hour ‘Hackathon’, we were highly intrigued where people would code for 24 hours straight and compete for a prize. Being freshman students in computer science we are both always working on a lot of coding projects but being a part of an intense academic curriculum, we tend to leave them incomplete many times. We thought the Philly Codefest would be the perfect opportunity for us to work on an entire project from start to finish.

  The 2019 Philly Code Fest had a theme of social inequality, which is something the both of us value. Being from India, a country which is still developing and faces plenty of problems, one of the first issues that came to mind was open defecation because it is something the government is working really hard on solving. Which is why we got the idea of creating a web and mobile application to help people find restrooms. Soon we realized we could add other features such as locations of soup kitchens and homeless shelters. We did this using the Google Maps JavaScript API, and getting the users current GPS coordinates and displaying nearby restrooms.

While developing this web app, we used a lot of the skills that we had learned about in CI102 and 103. For example, we created a scrum board with three columns on git hub before we started coding and wrote down all of the major components of the website that were required and put them in the ‘to-do’ column. The second column was ‘in progress’ and the third was ‘completed’.
This help us split our tasks among the group and work efficiently.

Secondly, we had a prior knowledge of git commands through the command line that we had learned in CI101. After going on a major sprint from 4 am till 8 am we got majority of the back-end work completed. Then finally we got to cleaning up the front-end to make the website look user friendly before we hosted it at 11am. However when it came to deploying the website, we ran into further trouble. We had planned to use Firebase as our hosting platform since it is an easy platform to use. But when we tried hosting it using Firebase, it said there’s and “unexpected error”. Later, we found out it was the cache files that messed it up!

One of our teammates, who was supposed to be responsible for the hosting of the website left the codefest and didn’t return until the results. Even though that was annoying and more work for the three of us, we didn’t lose our calm as we were close to finishing the product. The CI-10x courses helped us to understand that teamwork is not always fun. It gets hard sometimes and sometimes someone just doesn’t do whatever they’re supposed to do. One needs to recognize that and move on. The one thing we think that the CI courses has taught is that just one or two inefficient team members should never be allowed to jeopardize the purpose of the whole team. You need to know that the purpose of your team(if you believe in it) is much more important and bigger than that. 


Despite all of the problems we faced, we had a lot of fun.  Drinking dozens of Coffees and Energy Drinks to stay up for over 36 hours was an exhilarating experience. We got to meet some great people with whom we could riff off our ideas and get further feed back on how we could improve our product. We are looking forward to all the hackathons that we can attend in the future and, of course, Philly Codefest 2020.
